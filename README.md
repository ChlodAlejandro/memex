# memex
A simple PHP-based URL shortener.

**Highly in-development. The latest commit may not be working.**

# Installation
Requires PHP 7.2, and the required modules (see below), including a MySQL server ([`mariadb`](https://mariadb.org) suggested) at the bare minimum. Using any version of PHP lower than 7.2 is punishable by a possibly non-working Memex installation.

Required Apache modules include:
* `rewrite`
* *and that's it.*

**NOTE:** Analytics processing is to be implemented in a future commit.
